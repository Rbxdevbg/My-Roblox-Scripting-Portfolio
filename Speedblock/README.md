#  Speed Block System

This script adds +1 speed to any player who touches a special block. The block stores its own speed value, and players get faster every time they touch it.

##  How It Works

- When a player touches the block, it checks the block’s stored `SpeedValue`.
- The script increases the player's WalkSpeed by that value.
- You can customize the block’s speed by changing the `SpeedValue` inside the part.

##  Skills Used

- Touched events
- Server-side scripting
- Value instances (IntValue)
- WalkSpeed manipulation
